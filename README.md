# Generative_AI
Some lab books I have represented here were part of my learning of the course [Generative AI with Large Language Models](https://www.coursera.org/learn/generative-ai-with-llms) on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/).

**Key Learnings:**
- Large Language Models
- Generative AI
- Natural Language Processing
- Transformers & Prompt Engineering
- Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques: LoRA, Soft Prompts
- LLM application general architecture
